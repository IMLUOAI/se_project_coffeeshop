# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Z-index vertical stacking
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- After the first review, some unallowed errors were picked out by the reviewer, like "position attributes". I had used it in my entire CSS sheet to make my previous work reach the brief, but that's total wrong way to make it work. Finally, it's failed to pass.
- After 2 times failed the review, I followed the instrcution of the reviewer's comments stey by step seriously. It now looks very fluid and concise from inside to outside of the project. I wish I can get pass this time. As I experienced from the first project to the second one, I start to realize that SE as an engineer must to pursue a precise outcome on every single code and rule of their projects!
