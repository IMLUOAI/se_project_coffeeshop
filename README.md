Add your ideas here :)

- Part of the html structure is unclear. like the class="footer**social-heading" part, it supposes to has a container to wrap it with the class: "footer**list" container together, then the final outcome start to close to our giving brief demo. According to our current required syntax structure, I tried 10 times and failed 10 times.
- Speaking of the Menu and Footer part, what are the proper background height we suppoe to give? There is no reference value here. In my work, I gave them 50vh and 35vh resepctivly.
